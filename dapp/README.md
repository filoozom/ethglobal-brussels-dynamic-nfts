# Dapp

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Usage

```bash
# For local development
pnpm run dev

# For production deployment
pnpm run build
```

## Configuration

Most of the configuration is done in the [`src/lib/provider.ts`](src/lib/provider.ts) file. Granted, this isn't very professional, but this is for a hackathon after all, gotta keep it zany.
