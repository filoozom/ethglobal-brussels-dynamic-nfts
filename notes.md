- The subscription create page was quite buggy. I had to create a fresh Chrome profile and reinstall MetaMask for it to work.
- I get a "Invalid code location" error, but no reason as to why that may be. The code is accessible, more information is necessary from Chainlink's side.
- Chainlink doesn't yet support remote source code, which I lost half a day on
- Chainlink doesn't support args in imports (but it still works with `simulateScript`?)
  - Error: `TypeError: Requires net access to "MY_URL", run again with the --allow-net flag`
